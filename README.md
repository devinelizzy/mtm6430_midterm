# mtm6430_midterm

It seems to be a rite of passage in the Angular world to build a to-do list so in that tradition your mid-term project will be a.... to-do list!

Using Angular and Bootstrap, build a single page application that allows a user to display, create, edit & delete to-do items. While the idea of a todo list is not overly exciting (for some) the midterm will challenge you to take a set of given requirements and apply them to your implementation of the application.

Requirements:
the app will list all todo items 
completed items should be grouped at the bottom of the list and styled in a way that indicates their state
a user should see the description and due date for each item
each todo will have the following properties:
description
due date
completed flag
user can create, delete & edit items
Use Bootstrap for the UI 
Local Storage is to be used to persist items from session to session ( including edits )
 

Notes:
This assignment will serve as the foundation for the final in a few weeks
You are free to choose colours, styling and/or theme
 

Approach:
When considering how to tackle the assignment think of it as several small problems that you need to solve. Break each user interaction down into its smallest components and then assemble them to create the whole project.

 

Submission:
Please submit two links.  One to your github repository for this project, and a second to your working project on your edumedia.ca server.
